// Welcome Adventurer. Your aim is to navigate the maze and reach the finish point without touching any walls. 
// Doing so will kill you instantly!

// You will be given a 2D array of the maze and an array of directions. 
// Your task is to follow the directions given. If you reach the end point before all your moves have gone, you should return Finish. 
// If you hit any walls or go outside the maze border, you should return Dead. If you find yourself still in the maze after using all the moves, 
// you should return Lost.
