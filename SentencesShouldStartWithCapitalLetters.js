// In English, all words at the begining of a sentence should begin with a capital letter.

// You will be given a paragraph that does not use capital letters. Your job is to capitalise the first letter of the first word of each sentence.

// For example,

// input:

// "hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die."

// output:

// "Hello. My name is inigo montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."


const fix = (paragraph) => {
return paragraph
}

console.log(fix('hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.'))
